# You have to add "libtiff.so.5 tiff-4.5.1_1" (without the quotes)
# in a new line in common/shlibs. Viber only provides x64 binaries
# for this package, so it can't be cross-comiled, hence the
# "nocross=yes".  It's also advisable to remove or comment out
# (with a #) the newly inserted line "libtiff.so.5 tiff-4.5.1_1"
# in common/shlibs after you build the package.
