# numen for Void Linux

Numen is voice control letting you have full control of a Linux machine without needing to type. It empowers people who otherwise couldn't use their computers, and helps more avoid hand strain. Numen is free (libre) software and runs locally. You can view the video demonstration [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240425125404/https://files.catbox.moe/hcd4ul.webm).
