OpenBoard is a free and open-source interactive whiteboard software compatible with any projector and pointing device. It was originally forked from Open-Sankoré in 2013 with the intention to focus on simplicity and stability. The license was upgraded from LGPL-2.0-only to GPL-3.0-only. Since version 1.3 it is using the more recent QT 5 framework instead of QT version 4. Open-Sankoré itself is based on the Uniboard software originally developed at the University of Lausanne (UL), Switzerland.
