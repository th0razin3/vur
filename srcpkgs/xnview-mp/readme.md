<p align="center"><img src="https://codeberg.org/th0razin3/vur/raw/branch/main/srcpkgs/xnview-mp/xnview-mp.png"></p>

XnView MP is a versatile and powerful photo viewer, image management, image resizer. XnView is one of the most stable, easy-to-use, and comprehensive photo editors. All common picture and graphics formats are supported (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, WEBP, PSD, JPEG2000, OpenEXR, camera RAW, HEIC, PDF, DNG, CR2).

## Notes

The `Keygen.exe` file is located in `/opt/XnView/Keygen`. Yes, in order to register the software with the name that you'd like, you have to have Wine installed. The keygen is tested in Wine 9.6 and works OK. All you have to do is run `wine /opt/XnView/Keygen/Keygen.exe` from a terminal. If you don't have Wine installed, use the name and serial provided in `Serial.txt` in the same directory (`/opt/XnView/Keygen`). If you decide to remove XnView MP from your system, the `Keygen` directory will get removed as well, so you better make a copy of it if you'd like to keep the keygen.
