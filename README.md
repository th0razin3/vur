# th0razin3's Void Linux User Repository
This is my personal Void Linux user repository. Most xbps-src templates work, some are work in progress (it will be noted in a separate readme.md if the template is working or not).

Currently, this repository holds the following templates.
- Nero Linux 4 (Nero Burning ROM)
- Viber
