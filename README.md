# th0razin3's Void Linux User Repository
This is my personal Void Linux user repository. Most xbps-src templates work, some are work in progress (it will be noted in a separate readme.md if the template is working or not).

Currently, this repository holds the following templates.
- Nero Linux 4 (Nero Burning ROM for Linux)
- Viber
- ocenaudio

There is relevant info regarding each of the applications and/or quirks regarding packaging they might have in the adequate readme.md files in each of the subdirectories.

Regarding the package source files (versions and checksums), I can't always keep the versions and checksums up to date, so make sure you first check which is the newest version of the applications you'd like to package/repackage and change the `version` and `checksum` info in the template accoring to what's the newest version.

## How do I use this repository?
